I find myself with an increasing number of bash scripts, and increasing modifications, so I'm creating this git repo to hold them!

The nature of these scripts will vary a good bit. Some will be specific to my laptop or current Linux distro, others might be utility scripts I'm using to manage Amazon EC2 instances, etc.

I.e., some may be very useful to the public, while others may be less so. If you find something useful that you'd like to fork or contribute to, please let me know and I'd be happy to pull certain pieces into another repo, if that makes sense.
